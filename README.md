Project 3 of my comp class


    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    What did you do particularly well?
    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?




This project required us to prompt the user to input an item or word they wanted to look for, and then return a numeric value for the frequency of the specific word. It also prints a list with numbers that represent the frequency of all items purchased and then prints a histogram.

I feel as if the project went well, and it showcases how to do this assignment well.
I think the code is written decently, and I feel there are few places that could be improved as it works well too- but theres always room for improvement!
I found most of the project to be challenging. But, this is mostly due to me messing up nearly everything the first time and having to restart.
This project is a great example of using everything we learned in class this term. Nearly everything learned will be used in the future.
organization, spacing, and lables.
